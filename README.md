### Six Serving Men

I KEEP six honest serving-men

(They taught me all I knew);

Their names are **What** and **Why** and **When** 

And **How** and **Where** and **Who**.

I send them over land and sea,

I send them east and west;

But after they have worked for me,

I give them all a rest.

§

I let them rest from nine till five,

For I am busy then,

As well as breakfast, lunch, and tea,

For they are hungry men.

But different folk have different views;

I know a person small—

She keeps ten million serving-men,

Who get no rest at all!

§

She sends&#39;em abroad on her own affairs,

From the second she opens her eyes—

One million Hows, two million Wheres,

And seven million Whys!

§

(The Elephant's Child)
